# PloidPy
## Introduction
PloidPy is a program written in Python designed to infer ploidy from next-generation reads aligned to a haploid reference genome. The program makes use of a stastical model representing the distribution of specific nucleotide counts and selects the most probable ploidy on the basis of a minimum AIC.
